# HEADLESS CMS

Current Status:

- Takes in values from the input fields and adds them to the state using React Hooks.
- Changed the package.json build scripts slightly to accomodate loopback start and front end build/start 


Next Steps: 

- Add WYSIWYG
- Complete value function so that it makes proper calls to LoopBack routes
